Analysis in R for scoring prescreen surveys for AU24 PTSD pilot

Note Nov5 downloaded file is downloaded as "values" and Nov6 as "labels". USE VALUES. Labels is a hassle.

I've added the script I used for cleaning up Qualtrics data as well as how to score the PHQ for depression, PTSD-PDS (old version) and PDC-5 (new version).

Note that in the old version we didn't specify that the phobias had to have significant impact on daily functioning. New one does. FYI
